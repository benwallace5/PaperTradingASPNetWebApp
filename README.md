#Paper Trading Web Application
ASP .Net framework. Users sign up and can purchase stocks and crypto at real-time market price. User accounts are stored on the server in XML format using my login service. They can also view their portfolios. I deployed the web application and it's services on ASU's servers as part of the assignment.
